# CIS474TeamProject
This team project will involve building an online restaurant menu that handles orders from customers and records them in a database.
The main application is contained with WebApplication2.

#Update
The team project ended some time in December 2018. I have been trying to update the features of this program in order for others to be able to access a more fully featured code. It is far from commercial ready, but I have enhanced some of the features. Please see the commit history for mor info on what has been changed since December 2018.
